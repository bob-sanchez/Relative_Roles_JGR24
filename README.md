This reposititory contains a jupyter notebook to generate the figures in the JGR Oceans (submitted) paper "Relative roles of plume and coastal forcing on exchange flow variability in a glacial fjord". The notebook reads in netcdfs to make the figures. The netcdfs are stored on [Zenodo]([url](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11475032)). Questions should be emailed to rmsanche@ucsd.edu
